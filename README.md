# hello-world
My first directory, where I'm to put my ideas
I'm a not so experienced programmer that is very interested in codes involving LUA, JAVA and, especially, LUA for NodeMCU for home automation
I'm also a math teacher, physics teacher and english teacher
And I also have a heavy metal band :)
